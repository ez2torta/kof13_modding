# KOF13 Modding

## HowTo
- unluac has tools for lua decompiling.. also a little Python 3 XOR/UNXOR (they are the same) tool :)
- Also includes a script for batch unxoring/decompiling, might be useful if we get to do something

## Data (from google/forums/zenhax)
- .luas are XORed with 0x66 key and compiled. I used unluac (unluac_2015_06_13.jar) for decompiling. 
- What about compiling again? ://
